# Sellix Shop Template

This was basically a Sellix template I made back in 2019 or 2020. This was being re-sold by multiple people countless times over and over again. I thought it was about time to fully open source it, even though this isn't my best work anymore, I believe people may still be able to use it for their needs.

# Requirements

You will require website hosting - I suggest https://xoytek.co/
That website must have PHP, I suggest version 5.4 above.
Common sense to be able to edit a config.
And a sellix.io account.

All you need to do is edit the config.php.
There are some settings you may want to change in the styles.css.
